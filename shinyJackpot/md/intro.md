### What is this app?
This shiny application was created as supplementary marterial for our paper **ADD TITLE OF THE PAPER HERE**. <br><br>
This app allows users to explore the data interactively. You can find the data on [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/qwrxy/). Alternatively, you can download [lottodata](https://github.com/andr3wli/lottodata) - an R data package which provides easy access to the data sets. Future development plans for this app include adding different types of lottery games (scratch card tickets and fixed prize games). <br><br>
