Gambling Task</a>

#### What is this app?

An application to easily tidy, explore and visualize rat gambling task
data. As well, it can be especially useful for researchers using the RGT
in tandem with DREADDs. Check out our [paper]() accompanying this app.

#### Packages

The application uses the following packages:
[`shiny`](https://shiny.rstudio.com),
[`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org), [`shinythemes`](), and
[`shinyWidgets`](https://github.com/dreamRs/shinyWidgets). To see which
versions of these packages are used and there dependencies, look at the
`session_info.txt` file in the repo directory.

#### Launch application:

``` r
#shiny::runGitHub(repo = "andr3wli/shinyRGT")
```

Alternatively, it is available on my Shiny server
[here](https://andrewcli.shinyapps.io/shinyRGT/)
